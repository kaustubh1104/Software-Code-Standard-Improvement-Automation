# Software Code Standard Improvement Automation

This repository contains a research paper titled "Software Code Standard Improvement Automation", co-authored by Kaustubh Hemang Pandya, Nikunjkumar Khandar, and Priyank Nilesh Dabhi from Bishop’s University, Canada.

## 📄 Paper Overview

This study investigates the use of static code analysis tools within Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines, specifically Jenkins, in open-source projects hosted on GitHub and Bitbucket.

### 🔍 Key Objectives

- Identify which static analysis tools are commonly used in CI pipelines.
- Understand how these tools are configured.
- Analyze the types of issues (like build failures and warnings) these tools detect.
- Examine how developers respond to and resolve those issues.

### 🛠 Tools Explored

The paper evaluates tools such as:
- **Checkstyle** (Java)
- **Pylint, Pyflakes, Bandit, Safety, Pyupgrade** (Python)
- **CPPLint** (C++)

### 📊 Main Findings

- Most build failures stem from coding standard violations.
- Projects often configure tools to detect issues without breaking the build.
- Developers actively fix reported issues rather than bypass them.

### 📈 Value of the Study

The insights contribute to:
- Better CI practices
- Higher code quality assurance
- More efficient integration of static analysis tools in software development workflows
