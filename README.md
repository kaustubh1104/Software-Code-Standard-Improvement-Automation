# Software Code Standard Improvement Automation

This repository presents a student research project focused on automating code standard enforcement to improve consistency, readability, and overall software quality.

## 📚 About the Project

Modern software projects demand clean, consistent code. Manual enforcement of coding standards is error-prone and time-consuming. This project introduces an automated enforcement system using static analysis tools integrated into CI/CD pipelines (like Jenkins) to identify code quality issues early and enforce consistency automatically.
